# UI rules

## Code style
- Write concise TypeScript; use functional components and declarative JSX.
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. isLoading, hasError, canSubmit).
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication. One main component per file; default export for page-level components.

## Styling
- Use TailwindCSS for utility-first styling. Prefer design tokens (e.g. spacing, colors) from the project’s Tailwind config.
- Use semantic HTML (e.g. button, nav, main, section) where possible. Avoid div soup for landmarks.
- Keep responsive breakpoints consistent (sm/md/lg) and mobile-first.

## Accessibility
- Use aria-busy on buttons during submit; aria-label for icon-only controls; aria-live for dynamic status.
- Ensure focus management in modals and after async actions. Support keyboard navigation.
- Disable submit buttons when processing or when action is not applicable; do not rely only on visual state.

## Loading and states
- Show loading skeletons or spinners for async data. Use the project’s Skeleton component where it exists.
- Handle empty states with clear copy and a single primary CTA (e.g. “Explore services”, “Create business”).
- Do not leave users on a blank or generic error when the state is known (use UI_BOOKING_STATE, UI_ERROR_CONTEXT from constants).

## Imports and structure
- Use path alias @/ for project root. Component file names: kebab-case (e.g. booking-card.tsx). Exports: PascalCase.
- Structure: exported component first, then subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
