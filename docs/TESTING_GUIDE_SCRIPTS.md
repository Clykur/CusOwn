## 📊 Test Output

Each test provides step-by-step output:

```
🧪 Running: STEP 1: Customer logs in
   👤 User Action: Customer logs in
   Customer ID: abc12345...
✅ PASSED: STEP 1: Customer logs in

🧪 Running: STEP 2: Browse available businesses
   👤 User Action: Customer browses businesses
   Found 5 businesses
✅ PASSED: STEP 2: Browse available businesses
```

## ✅ What Gets Tested

### User Flows

- ✅ Customer browsing and booking
- ✅ Owner setup and management
- ✅ Admin operations
- ✅ Complete booking lifecycle
- ✅ Payment processing
- ✅ Concurrent operations
- ✅ Error handling

### Security

- ✅ Business suspension enforcement
- ✅ Race condition prevention
- ✅ State machine enforcement
- ✅ Invalid operation rejection

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"No active business found"**
→ Create a business with `suspended = false`

**"No available slot found"**
→ Generate slots for tomorrow

**"Missing Supabase credentials"**
→ Check `.env.local` file

## 📊 Test coverage commands

| Command                              | What it measures                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run test:unit:vitest`           | Unit tests + **source code** coverage (4 API routes at 100%)                                 |
| `npm run test:coverage:test-classes` | Unit tests + **test-class** coverage (how much of the test files are executed; targets 100%) |
| `npm run test:coverage:all`          | Runs both: source coverage then test-class coverage                                          |

Use **test-class coverage** to ensure every line in your test files is run when the suite executes.

## 📈 Success Criteria

All tests should:

- ✅ Complete without errors
- ✅ Clean up test data
- ✅ Report pass/fail status
- ✅ Simulate real user behavior

**When all tests pass, the system is ready for production!** 🚀
